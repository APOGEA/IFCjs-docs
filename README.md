This repository is the official documentation of [IFC.js](https://github.com/IFCjs). You can visit it live [here](https://ifcjs.github.io/info/). It contains all the information regarding the project, including:

* The motivation behind IFC.js.

* API reference.

* Step by step tutorials.

* Informal articles of the authors.

* Collaboration system and patreon.

* Community highlight.

* Link to social networks.

## Status

This documentation has been made using  [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). It is hand-crafted, not automatically generated. At the same time, IFC.js is a fast-moving project, and that means that the documentation requires intensive maintenance until the project is consolidated.

We are aware of the extra effort this implies, but we want to avoid generic and robotic APIs and make something more human and easy to start with.

This maintenance includes mainly updating the API methods and classes, creating new tutorials as requested by the community. This is a work in progress, so if you see something missing or incorrect, don't hesitate to let us know.

## Quick setup

First, download this project or clone the repository and install the dependencies with `yarn install`. You can then start the project locally using `yarn start`.

To start the project in another lanaguage, you can use the `--locale` flag:
