### As an individual

Our patreon system is super simple: you give **$5/month** to the project to help IFC.js keep growing. However, **we don't believe that open source should depend on altruistic donations**. For this reason, all patreons gain access to the following:

## Where does my money go?

We manage all money openly and transparently through OpenCollective. That means that anyone can see who has put how much money into the project. Every time we want to use that money we will have to upload an invoice that will be published on the same page. That way, the money is as open as the code.
