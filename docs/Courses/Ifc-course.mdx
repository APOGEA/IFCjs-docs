## What's this about?

Our projects are becoming more and more complex, and that means that it is often not possible to carry them out with the tools of a single brand. Open BIM is the solution to this problem; it is increasingly present in our workflows, and IFC is its foundation.

<IfcCard>
	IFC allows the exchange of information between applications of different vendors, as well as accessing the information without depending on a single application / licensing policy.
</IfcCard>

However, documentation is not easy and it is often difficult to discern what is really important to know from this scheme. **In this course we are going to teach you all the knowledge we have needed to develop IFC.js.**
