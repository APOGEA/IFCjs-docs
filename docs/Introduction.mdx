IFC.js is a JavaScript library to load, display and edit IFC models in the browser. Try the [live demo](https://ifcjs.github.io/web-ifc-viewer/examples/simple-html/) with your IFC model and discover the power of IFC.js.

## What is this library?

### What is IFC?

  üè†
Architects no longer draw building plans one by one, but create 3D models of buildings, much like the houses modelled in [The SIMS](https://www.ea.com/es-es/games/the-sims). This way of working is called BIM (Building Information Model), because the models created contain both geometry and information.

  üî• 
However, a building is so complex that there is no single application that can create these models in their entirety. Each application has a specific mission modelling geometry, calculating structures, making energy simulations, creating project documents, and so on. 

  üëÄ
These tools come from multiple developers around the world and each one works in its own format. In other words, the structural model created by a structural calculation application cannot be read by the energy simulation software, and vice versa. So how is it possible to create a model of a building from multiple tools?

  üéâ
The answer is [**IFC**](https://www.buildingsmart.org/standards/bsi-standards/industry-foundation-classes/), a format created by BuildingSMART to contain these 3D models of buildings. It is open, so anyone can read and write it. Yay! 

  <IfcAlert>
Thanks to IFC any developer can freely create BIM apps that can communicate with the apps of the big development companies in the construction sector. 
  </IfcAlert>


### The problem of IFC

Anyone who wants to make a BIM application **needs to read and write IFC files** to be able to import and export information from other tools. Unfortunately, IFC is a format that is difficult to read and write. There are thousands of pages of documentation and creating and maintaining an self-made IFC parser is a huge task.

  <IfcCard title="  
Can you afford IFC?"
    >
  üí∏
This is something only companies with several developers working full time on this could afford. It doesn't sound that open anymore, does it?  
  </IfcCard>

In case you are curious about how an IFC looks like inside, here you have an example. Imagine parsing hundreds of thousands of lines like these:

  ```js
  #6699= IFCCARTESIANPOINT((0.,-1.7053025E-13));
  #6701= IFCAXIS2PLACEMENT2D(#6699,#23);
  #6703= IFCCARTESIANPOINT((892.,-253.399999,150.));
  #6705= IFCAXIS2PLACEMENT3D(#6703,#15,#19);
  #6706= IFCEXTRUDEDAREASOLID(#6702,#6705,#19,506.8);
  #6707= IFCCOLOURRGB($,0.50196,0.501913,0.501960);
  ```

  üíÄ
Even if you are willing to create a parser from scratch and maintain it with every change in the IFC schema, there are several non-trivial questions to tackle this problem. How to manage memory in very large files? How to implement geometric generation efficiently? What to do when an IFC has not been defined correctly? 

### IFC.js to the rescue

It wouldn't make sense for all developers to have to implement their own IFC file reader and writer for their applications when we all what the same thing: **importing and exporting geometry and data**.

  <IfcCard>
IFC.js is a JavaScript library that makes it super easy to read and write IFC files. 
  </IfcCard>

This allows developers of architecture and construction applications to work in IFC effortlessly and focus on the functionalities that really add value to their business.

## IFC.js in a nutshell

IFC.js has two focuses:

  <IfcCard title=
  "üíé
Geometry"
  >
IFC.js is able to generate 3D scenes because it is compatible with 3D libraries such as Three.js or Babylon.js. This means that you can create 3D  BIM tools right away.
  </IfcCard>

  <IfcCard title=
  "üîó
Data"
  >
High-level access to all the properties associated with that geometry. This means easy access to data on the building components, their materials, thermal characteristics, structural strength, etc.
  </IfcCard>

Creating a BIM applications with IFC.js is as easy as creating a webpage with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. If you don't have any IFC file available, try loading any of [these](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MwRsL3ZnlyhWEVUko9wAnklaMne3pp3h?usp=sharing).

  <IfcScene></IfcScene>

  ```js
  import { IfcLoader } from 'web-ifc-three';
  import { Scene } from 'three';

  //Creates THREE.js scene
  const scene = new Scene();

  //...

  //Loads IFC and adds it to the scene
  const ifcLoader = new IfcLoader();
  ifcLoader.load(ifcURL, (geometry) => scene.add(geometry));
  ```

## Who is this library for

This library is for anyone who wants to develop BIM applications: both developers creating applications for the construction industry and architects and other professionals who want to take advantage of the data contained in their IFC files.

To use this library it is necessary to have a basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This knowledge is beyond the scope of this documentation. You'll also need to use some 3D library to display the geometry of the IFC (Three.js or Babylon.js). 

üòä If you don't know where to start, we suggest you to take a look [here](https://threejsfundamentals.org/) or just join the [Discord Channel](https://discord.com/invite/g7Uzn2KSwB) and say hi.

## Why is IFC.js different?

IFC.js is a library written by and for JavaScript, arguably one of the most ubiquitous languages. This means that it is compatible with web browsers, desktop and mobile applications. JavaScript is also one of the easiest languages to learn, and allows you to build user interfaces with HTML and CSS. In other words, creating BIM applications with IFC.js is as easy as creating a web page.

### Multiplatform

You can use IFC.js to create open BIM applications for any platform:

<IfcTab 
  bigTitles="true"
  items={
    [
      { name: "üåè",
      content: 
<p><b>Frontend web applications</b> that read and write IFC files and display 3D without relying on server communication can be created using vanilla JavaScript or other tools such as React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc. That is, <i>with IFC.js we can turn any web browser into an open BIM app.</i></p>
      }, 
      { name: "üè¢",
      content: 
<p>There are cases where the IFC file cannot be processed at the client. For example, a mobile device may not have the power to display several medium or large IFCs. In this case it is possible to <b>use IFC.js on the server</b> via Node.js and send the Three.js scene already prepared to the client.</p>}, 
      { name: "üíª", 
      content: 
<p>Sometimes we don't want to create web applications, but <b>native desktop applications that run on Windows, iOS and Linux</b>. This is possible thanks to technologies like Electron. These native applications will be programmed in the same way as web applications; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, etc.</p>}, 
      { name: "üì±",
      content: 
<p>IFC.js also supports React Native, which maps WebGL code to native OpenGL. This means that you can create IFC-compatible <b>Open BIM apps that run on Android and iOS</b> easily.</p>}
    ]
    }></IfcTab>

### Speed

  ‚è±Ô∏è
If you have experience with web applications, you might be thinking that the weak point of a JavaScript-based IFC library is performance. However, the core of the library is developed in C++ combined with WebAssembly and [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/). It is designed specifically for **maximum performance**, allowing IFC.js to approach the speed and performance of desktop applications while running directly in the browser.

## Source code

IFC.js is a large, multi-language library (C++, TypeScript JavaScript, etc). Having it in a single repository would be difficult and unwieldy. For that reason, the library exists in multiple repositories, where each one has its own purpose. You can find them [here](https://github.com/IFCjs).

<IfcTab items={
    [
      { name: 
"web-ifc",
      link: "https://github.com/tomvandig/web-ifc",
      content: 
"This is the repository containing the core of the library: a parser and geometry generator written from scratch in C++ and compiled via Emscripten to WebAssembly. This repository encapsulates the complexity of reading IFC files and loading their data into memory."
      }, 
      { name: "web-ifc-three",
      link: "https://github.com/IFCjs/web-ifc-three",
      content: 
"This is the library that adapts web-ifc to Three.js geometric entities. This library is theofficial IFC Loader of Three.js.Thanks to this adapter open BIM applications can be created with Three.js in just two lines of code."}, 
      { name: "web-ifc-viewer",
      link: "https://github.com/IFCjs/web-ifc-viewer",
      content: 
"This is a browser-based IFC viewer and a boilerplate library with many examples of what can be done with IFC.js and three.js. All BIM applications have common functionalities: scene navigation, material changes, element selection by clicking on them, section plans, etc. There is an example of all these functionalities in this repository, so it can be reused in open BIM applications out of the box."}
