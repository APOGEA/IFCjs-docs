## Introduction

  üé©
In almost all BIM applications, user-selected elements are highlighted when the user moves the mouse over them or selects them. IFC.js is no exception, and in this tutorial we will see how to achieve this.

Previously </a> we have seen how to obtain the ID of an object on which we cast a ray with the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Raycaster">Raycaster</a>. Now that we have those IDs, it's possible to highlight those elements using <b>geometric subsets</b>.

<IfcCard icon="üß±" title="Geometric subsets?">
<b>Geometric subsets</b> are any group of items in the model. For example: all doors, all ground floor elements or all elements fulfilling a given condition.
</IfcCard>

### Import dependencies

We'll need a [material](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/Material) to highlight the items. You can choose any material you like; in this example we'll use a [MeshLambertmaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshLambertMaterial), which we'll import from Three's core library.

```js
import {
  MeshLambertMaterial
} from "three";
```

We'll also use the Raycaster, so you'll also need <a href="https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Guide/web-ifc-three/Tutorials/Picking/#import-threejs-dependencies" target="_self">those dependencies</a>, as well as <a href="https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Guide/web-ifc-three/Tutorials/Picking/#import-three-mesh-bvh-optional" target="_self">three-mesh-bvh</a> if we want optimal performance.

## How to do it

### Highlight material

The first thing is to create the highlight material. You can do this however you like, although we like to use `depthTest=false` so that the object is visible from any viewpoint.

```js
  // Creates subset material
  const mat = new MeshLambertMaterial({
      transparent: true,
      opacity: 0.6,
      color: 0xff00ff,
      depthTest: false
  })
```
Note that geometric subsets are identified by their material.

- If you create a subset with a wall using a material A, and then try to create a subset of another wall with the same material A, the second wall will be added to the subset of the first one.

- If you create a subset with a wall using material A, and then try to create another subset of the same wall using material B, you will have created two independent subsets.

Note that you can have two separate subsets with the same appearance creating two instances of the same material.

### Single subset

It is very common that when the user hovers the mouse over an element, the element is softly illuminated. We can achieve this effect using `createSubset`.


```js {15,16,17,18,19,20,21}
function pick(event) {
    const found = cast(event)[0];
    if (found) {

        // Gets model ID
        const modelID = found.object.modelID;

        // Gets Express ID
        const index = found.faceIndex;
        const geometry = found.object.geometry;
        const ifc = ifcLoader.ifcManager;
        const id = ifc.getExpressId(geometry, index);

        // Creates subset
        ifcLoader.ifcManager.createSubset({
            modelID: modelID,
            ids: [id],
            material: mat,
            scene: scene,
            removePrevious: true
        })
    }
}

window.onmousemove = pick;
```

There are several interesting things to look out for:
