## ü§è Introduction

We don't want to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">repeat ourselves</a>; not even in our documentation.

The setup for starting a project with web-ifc has already been seen in <a target="_self" href="https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Hello%20world">Hello World</a>. If you have skipped that point, we recommend you to go and have a look at it.

You are free to follow these tutorials using the `Three.js IFCLoader` instead.
