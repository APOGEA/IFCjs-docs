## ðŸŒµ DRY documentation

We don't want to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">repeat ourselves</a>; not even in our documentation.

  ðŸ‘€
The setup for starting a project with web-ifc has already been seen in <a href="https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Hello%20world">Hello World</a>. If you have skipped that point, we recommend you to go and have a look at it.

You are free to follow these tutorials using the `Three.js IFCLoader` instead.

<IfcCard icon="ðŸš¦" title="Before going forward">
    Basic knowledge of Three.js and web development is assumed. If you don't have this background, we recommend that you start <a href="https://threejsfundamentals.org/">here</a> before jumping into IFC.js.
