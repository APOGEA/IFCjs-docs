## Full IFC control at native speed

It is often thought that web applications are not as powerful as desktop applications. Relatively recently, however, WebAssembly appeared on the scene. It is a technology that allows the use of compiled languages to create web applications.

This means we can have the best of both worlds: the flexibility of a web application and the full CPU power of a machine. And this is what web-ifc is all about.

    âš¡
    It is as fast as native applications thanks to its parsing core, written from scratch in C++.

    It can be run directly on the client or as a backend service. Bring BIM to all parts of your system!

<IfcCard>
    ðŸ“š
    It can read 100% of the IFC data, including types. This allows data to be easily extracted, structured, traversed and entered into databases.

    ðŸŒˆ
It can edit data and write entire IFCs from scratch. Create apps that communicate with the large software vendors.

In the following points, the API and its functionalities will be shown step by step. However, there are a couple of issues that are important to be clear about before using web-ifc.

### But wait, I don't know C++!

### What is the .wasm file for?

### When should I use web-ifc?
